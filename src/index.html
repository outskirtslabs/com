        <p class="lead">Software doesn't make change, people make change. Software can help them
                        along.</p>

        <p>


          For over 9 years I've been solving tough problems for clients
          all over the spectrum: non-profits, human rights and
          developmental organizations, to companies in the
          communications, education, research science sectors. They all
          have two things in common:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>a cause worth pursuing</strong>
          <li><strong>passion and energy to see it done right</strong>
        </ol>

        <p>

          I love working for clients who are trying to <strong>change the
                                                               world</strong> , or at least <em>their
                                                                                                corner
                                                                                                of
                                                                                                it</em>.
          It
          doesn't matter if you're a large company, NGO,
          non-profit, or a small social enterprise. I work with organizations of all sizes.

        </p>
        <p>

          It is my prerogative to work with great people on great
          projects. I don't compromise on quality or responsibility, and
          <strong>only take projects where I can deliver the most
                  value</strong>.

        </p>

        <p>

          I limit the number of clients I work with so I can invest in
          the <em>relationships that I am committed to.</em> If I work with you
          it's because I am excited about your project and believe I can
          boost it by committing to you.

        </p>
        <p class="lead"> All good causes deserve a chance to flourish, and I'm here to help them do
                         so.</p>

        <p>

          Technology isn't a magic bullet. An app or flashy website isn't
          going to solve anything by itself. But technology combined with
          passionate people, a sharp vision, and superb technical
          execution, <strong>can change the world</strong>.

        </p>

        <p>

          I want to get to know you, your idea, and your organization
          then work with you to craft <em>a development strategy</em>
          suited to your goals. Together we can make your idea, reality.

      <h1>My Ethical Statement</h1>

      <p class="summary">I truly believe in seeing my clients
                         get the best possible return on their investment. But some things are
                         more important than work and money.</p>

    <article>
      <h2>Saying yes to cause-focused organizations</h2>

      <p>I love supporting charities, non-profits, social enterprises,
         and other organizations devoted to making a positive difference in
         the world.
      <p>To a few of these organizations I offer reduced rates, plus I keep an amount of
         pro-bono days in stock for consultation and development.</p>


      <h2>Saying yes to open source</h2>

      <p>Sharing is caring, especially when it comes to producing social
         impact. <a href="http://www.revsys.com/writings/oss-in-business.html"
                    title="Using Open Source in Business" target="_blank">Others</a> have made the
         open source case <a
            href="http://opensource.org/advocacy/case_for_business.php" target="_blank"
            title="open source case for business">for
                                                  businesses</a>, I don't need to here. I offer
         reduced rates on projects
         that heavily use open-source or go open-source themselves.</p>

      <h2>Saying no to exploitation</h2>

      <p>I do not work with organizations who exploit human rights, are
         associated with the industrial military complex, harvest unmanaged
         natural resources, or are involved in cruelty to animals.</p>

      <h2>Keeping it simple</h2>

      <p>
        Technology that no one can use is not just wasted time and effort,
        it's wrong. I want my work for you to be ready to use, like you
        need it, right away. I'll keep the solutions I deliver to you as
        simple as possible. When it is time to grow, I'll ensure that
        growth is thought out and straight-forward.
      </p>

      <h2>Doing what's right</h2>

      <p>I don't mean to sound judgemental with this statement. Integrity and
         professionalism in business are my priorities, and being open
         about which projects and clients align with my values is part of
         that. Contact me directly if you have any comments or questions
         about this ethical statement.</p>

      <h2 id="pr-01">Why we value your privacy</h2>
      <p>We value your privacy as much as we do our own, so we’re committed to keeping your personal
         and business information safe. We’re uncomfortable with the information companies,
         governments, and other organisations keep on file, so we ask for only the bare minimum from
         our customers. We’ll never use your personal information for any reason other than why you
         gave it, and we’ll never give anyone access to it unless we’re forced to by law.</p>
      <h2 id="pr-02">How we collect information</h2>
      <p>We ask for contact information including your name, email address, and phone number, on our
         website so that we can reply to your enquiry.</p>
      <p>Our website doesn’t use cookies or scripts that were designed to track the websites you
         visit. We don’t use analytics or native social media ‘like’ or ‘sharing’ buttons which also
         build profiles of your internet activity.</p>
      <p>We collect your email address when you sign up for one of our newsletters.</p>
      <p>We ask for your account and contact information when you hire or buy something from us.</p>
      <p>Occasionally, we might receive your contact information from one of our partners. If we do,
         we protect it in exactly the same way as if you give it to us directly.</p>
      <h2 id="pr-03">What information we hold</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>When you contact us by email or through our website, we collect your name, email
            address, phone number, a social media username, and the company you work for, if you’ve
            given us that.
        </li>
        <li>If you sign up for a newsletter, we only collect your email address.</li>
        <li>When you buy something from us, we collect your name, email address, phone number, and a
            delivery address.
        </li>
        <li>If you do business with us, we also collect your business name and bank details and keep
            records of the invoices we send you and the payments you make.
        </li>
        <!--<li>All purchases are processed by [<span contenteditable="true">_</span>], our ecommerce platform and we never have access to your credit card information.</li>-->
      </ul>
      <h2 id="pr-04">Where we store your information</h2>
      <p>If you sign up for a newsletter, we store your email address in MailChimp, which is the
         marketing platform we prefer.
         <!--When you buy something, your information is stored in [<span contenteditable="true">_</span>], our ecommerce platform.-->
         If we do business, we store your information in our accounts software, Zoho Books. We chose
         these systems partly for their commitment to security.</p>
      <h2 id="pr-05">What we use your information for</h2>
      <p>We occasionally use your contact information to send you details of our products and
         services. When we do, you have the option to unsubscribe from these communications and we
         won’t send them to you again. We might also email or phone you about our products and
         services, but if you tell us not to, we won’t get in touch again. We will use your
         information to send you invoices, statements, or reminders.</p>
      <h2 id="pr-06">Who’s responsible for your information at our company</h2>
      <p>Casey Link, is responsible for the security of your information. You can contact me by
         email at casey@outskirtslabs.com or by phone at +43 677 61 59 59 37 if you have any
         concerns about the information we store.</p>
      <h2 id="pr-07">Who has access to information about you</h2>
      <p>When we store information in our own systems, only the people who need it have access.
         Individual employees or third-party contractors (such as accountants and lawyers) have
         access to only what they need to do their job.</p>
      <h2 id="pr-08">The steps we take to keep your information private</h2>
      <p>Where we store your information in third-party services, we restrict access only to people
         who need it. We store passwords in Keepass, an encrypted password manager, use a different,
         randomly generated password for each service, and never use the same password twice.</p>
      <p>The computers we use are all encrypted using dm-crypt/LUKS or File Vault and are protected
         by a passcode. These computers ask for authentication whenever they’re started or after 5
         minutes of inactivity. Our mobile devices are also protected by passcode.</p>
      <h2 id="pr-09">How to complain</h2>
      <p>We take complaints very seriously. If you’ve any reason to complain about the ways we
         handle your privacy, please contact Casey directly by email at casey@outskirtslabs.com or
         by phone on +43 677 61 59 59 37. If you’re the letter writing type, send your envelope to
         Casey Link, Sankt-georgs-weg 8, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria, Europe.</p>
      <h2 id="pr-10">Changes to the policy</h2>
      <p>If we change the contents of this policy, those changes will become effective the moment we
         publish them on our website.</p>
